            <h2>Question 3: How does JavaScript Event loop work</h2>
            <h3>Answer :</h3>
            <p>The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows the browser to efficiently handle multiple concurrent tasks by using a call stack to keep track of function calls and an event queue to hold events that have occurred but have not yet been processed. The event loop checks the event queue for events that are ready to be processed and executes the corresponding function on the call stack.</p>

            <h2>Question 5: how the chooseQuiz function works</h2>
            <h3>Answer :</h3>
            <p>
                The chooseQuiz function updates an array of answers based on the user's input for a given quiz question. If the user has already answered the question before, the function updates the existing answer object in the array. If not, it adds a new answer object to the array. The function then calls another function to display the answers on the screen.
